title: "Himitsu: A novel keyring & password manager for Unix"
---

**Abstract**

> Himitsu is a novel design for a key/value store to securely store your
> passwords, private keys, and other secrets. It is a simple core upon which a
> highly extensible ecosystem of integrations can be built to handle any kind of
> secret. This talk will introduce the Himitsu key store, demonstrate many of
> the things it is capable of, and explain its current level of sophistication
> and what we aspire for in the future.
