title: Introducing the Hare programming langauge
---

**Abstract**

>  Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and
>  robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a
>  minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system
>  tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance
>  tasks.
