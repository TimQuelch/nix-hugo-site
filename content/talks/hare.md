title: Introducing the Hare programming langauge
---

**Abstract**

> qbe is an optimizing compiler backend which consumes programs in a simple
> intermediate language, optimizes them, and emits assembly for x86_64, aarch64,
> or riscv64, aiming to achieve "70% of the performance" of advanced compilers
> like LLVM in "10% of the code". This talk will briefly introduce qbe and its
> intermediate language, explain how it works and what it's capable of, and go
> over some sample programs which can be written in it.
