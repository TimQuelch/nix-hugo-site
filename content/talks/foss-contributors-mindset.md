title: The FOSS contributor's mindset
---

**Abstract**

> Many people use free software, and a fraction of them have dipped their toes
> into contributing - publishing their own projects, or contributing to one or
> two. Too few, however, have completely grokked the opportunities the expansive
> free software ecosystem offers to us.
>
> This talk will discuss how to contribute to a wider variety of projects,
> introduce useful tools for quickly coming to grips with a foreign codebase,
> and explain the mindset that these tools help to cultivate.
