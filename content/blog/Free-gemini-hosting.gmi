I updated SourceHut pages today to support static Gemini capsules in addition to HTTP websites. This is available to any sourcehut user as part of your normal sr.ht subscription. You get `yourname.srht.site` for free, and can bring your own domains as well. Check out the details here:

=> gemini://srht.site sourcehut capsules

Enjoy!
