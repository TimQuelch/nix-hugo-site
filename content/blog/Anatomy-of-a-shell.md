I've been contributing where I can to Simon Ser's [mrsh][mrsh] project, a
work-in-progress strictly POSIX shell implementation. I worked on some small
mrsh features during my holiday travels and it's in the forefront of my mind, so
I'd like to share some of its design details with you.

[mrsh]: https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/mrsh

There are two main components to a shell: parsing and execution. mrsh uses a
simple [recursive descent parser][rd-parser] to generate an AST (Abstract Syntax
Tree, or an in-memory model of the structure of the parsed source). This design
was chosen to simplify the code and avoid dependencies like flex/bison, and is a
good choice given that performance isn't critical for parsing shell scripts.
Here's an example of the input source and output AST:

[rd-parser]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser

```sh
#!/bin/sh
say_hello() {
	echo "hello $1!"
}

who=$(whoami)
say_hello "$who"
```

This script is parsed into this AST (this is the output of `mrsh -n test.sh`):

```
program
program
└─command_list ─ pipeline
  └─function_definition say_hello ─ brace_group
    └─command_list ─ pipeline
      └─simple_command
        ├─name ─ word_string [3:2 → 3:6] echo
        └─argument 1 ─ word_list (quoted)
          ├─word_string [3:8 → 3:14] hello
          ├─word_parameter
          │ └─name 1
          └─word_string [3:16 → 3:17] !
program
program
└─command_list ─ pipeline
  └─simple_command
    └─assignment
      ├─name who
      └─value ─ word_command ─ program
        └─command_list ─ pipeline
          └─simple_command
            └─name ─ word_string [6:7 → 6:13] whoami
program
└─command_list ─ pipeline
  └─simple_command
    ├─name ─ word_string [7:1 → 7:10] say_hello
    └─argument 1 ─ word_list (quoted)
      └─word_parameter
        └─name who
```

Most of these names come directly from the [POSIX shell specification][spec].
The parser and AST is made available as a standalone public interface of
libmrsh, which can be used for a variety of use-cases like syntax-aware text
editors, syntax highlighting (see [`highlight.c`][hl.c]), linters, etc. The most
important use-case is, of course, task planning and execution.

[spec]: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html
[hl.c]: https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/mrsh/tree/master/highlight.c

Most of these AST nodes becomes a *task*. A task defines an implementation of
the following interface:

```c
struct task_interface {
	/**
	 * Request a status update from the task. This starts or continues it.
	 * `poll` must return without blocking with the current task's status:
	 *
	 * - TASK_STATUS_WAIT in case the task is pending
	 * - TASK_STATUS_ERROR in case a fatal error occured
	 * - A positive (or null) code in case the task finished
	 *
	 * `poll` will be called over and over until the task goes out of the
	 * TASK_STATUS_WAIT state. Once the task is no longer in progress, the
	 * returned state is cached and `poll` won't be called anymore.
	 */
	int (*poll)(struct task *task, struct context *ctx);
	void (*destroy)(struct task *task);
};
```

Most of the time the task will just do its thing. Many tasks will have sub-tasks
as well, such as a command list executing a list of commands, or each branch of
an if statement, which it can defer to with `task_poll`. Many tasks will wait on
an external process, in which case it can return TASK_STATUS_WAIT to have the
process `wait`ed on. Feel free to browse the [full list of tasks][tasks] to get
an idea.

One concern more specific to POSIX shells is built-in commands. Some commands
have to be built-in because they manipulate the shell's state, such as `.` and
`cd`. Others, like `true` & `false`, are there for performance reasons, since
they're simple and easily implemented internally. POSIX specifies [a list of
special builtins][builtins] which are necessary to implement in the shell
itself. There's [a second list][utilities] that must be present for the shell
environment to be considered POSIX compatible (plus some reserved names like
`local` and `pushd` that invoke undefined behavior - mrsh aborts on these).

I might write more articles in the future diving into specific concepts, feel
free to shoot me an email if you have suggestions. Shoutout to Simon for
building such a cool project! I'm looking forward to contributing more until we
have a really nice strictly POSIX shell.
