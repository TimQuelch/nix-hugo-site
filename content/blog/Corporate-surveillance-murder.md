I have never been angrier about the corporate surveillance complex, which I have
rallied against for *years*, than I am today. Buying and selling user's private
information on the open market is bad enough for the obvious reasons, but today,
I learned that the depths of depravity this market will descend to are without
limit. Today I am more angry and ashamed at this industry than I have ever been.
Corporate surveillance and adtech has turned your phone into an informant
against you and brought about the actual **murder** of the user.

Say you're a Muslim. You download some apps for reading the Quran and
participating in Muslim-oriented social networks. These ads steal whatever
personal information it can get its hands on, through any means available, and
sell it to [Locate X][0], who stores every GPS location your phone has visited
and tags it as being associated with a Muslim. This is used, say, to place
Muslim-targeted ads on billboards in Muslim-dense areas. It's also sold to the
Iowa National Guard, who uses it to conduct drone strikes. The app you installed
is selling your GPS data so it can be used to *kill you*.

For a long time, I have preached "respect the user". I want us, as programmers,
to treat the user with the same standards of common decency and respect we'd
afford to our neighbors. It seems I have to revise my sermon to "don't murder
the user"! If you work at a company which surveilles its users, [you are
complicit][1] in these murders. You have written software which is used to
*murder people*.

This industry is in severe need of a moral health check. You, the reader of
this article, need to take personal responsibility for what your code is doing.
Your boss isn't going to. Do you really know what that database is being used
for, or who it's being sold to, or who it *might* be sold to in the future? Most
companies include their hoard of private, personal information about their users
as part of their valuation. Do you have stock options, by the way?

I've often heard the excuse that employees of large surveillance companies "want
to feed their families, like anyone else". Well, thanks to your work, a child
you've never met was orphaned, and doesn't have a family anymore. Who's going to
feed them? Is there really no other way for you to support your family?

Don't fucking kill your users.
