title: How new Linux users can increase their odds of success

The [Linus Tech Tips] YouTube channel has been putting out a series of videos
called the [Switching to Linux Challenge] that has been causing a bit of a stir
in the Linux community. I've been keeping an eye on these developments, and
thought it was a good time to weigh in with my thoughts. This article focuses on
how new Linux users can increase their odds for success &mdash; I have also
written a companion article, "[What desktop Linux needs to succeed in the
mainstream][0]", which looks at the other side of the problem.

Linux is, strictly speaking, an operating system *kernel*, which is a small
component of a larger system. However, in the common usage, Linux refers to a
family of operating systems which are based on this kernel, such as Ubuntu,
Fedora, Arch Linux, Alpine Linux, and so on, which are referred to as
*distributions*. Linux is used in other contexts, such as Android, but the
common usage is generally limited to this family of Linux "distros". Several of
these distros have positioned themselves for various types of users, such as
office workers or gamers. However, the most common Linux user is much different.
What do they look like?

The key distinction which sets Linux apart from more common operating systems
like Windows and macOS is that Linux is *open source*. This means that the
general public has access to the *source code* which makes it tick, and that
anyone can modify it or improve it to suit their needs. However, to make
meaningful modifications to Linux requires programming skills, so,
consequentially, the needs which Linux best suits are the needs of programmers.
Linux is the preeminent operating system for programmers and other highly
technical computer users, for whom it can be suitably molded to purpose in a
manner which is not possible using other operating systems. As such, it has
been a resounding success on programmer's workstations, on servers in the cloud,
for data analysis and science, in embedded workloads like internet-of-things,
and other highly technical domains where engineering talent is available and a
profound level of customization is required.

The Linux community has also developed Linux as a solution for desktop users,
such as the mainstream audience of Windows and macOS. However, this work is
mostly done by enthusiasts, rather than commercial entities, so it can vary in
quality and generally any support which is available is offered on a
community-run, best-effort basis. Even so, there have always been a lot of
volunteers interested in this work &mdash; programmers want a working desktop,
too. Programmers also want to play games, so there has been interest in getting
a good gaming setup working on Linux. In the past several years, there has
also been a commercial interest with the budget to move things forward: Valve
Software. Valve has been instrumental in developing more sophisticated gaming
support on Linux, and uses Linux as the basis of a commercial product, the Steam
Deck.[^1]

[^1]: Full disclosure: I represent a company which has a financial relationship with Valve and is involved in the development of software used by the Steam Deck.

Even so, I must emphasize the following point:

**The best operating system for gaming is Windows.**

Trying to make Linux do all of the things you're used to from Windows or macOS
is not going to be a successful approach. It is *possible* to run games on
Linux, and it is *possible* to run some Windows software on Linux, but it is not
*designed* to do these things, and you will likely encounter some papercuts on
the way. Many advanced Linux users with a deep understanding of the platform and
years of experience under their belt can struggle for days to get a specific
game running. However, thanks to Valve, and the community at large, many games
&mdash; but not all games &mdash; run out-of-the-box with much less effort than
was once required of Linux gamers.

Linux users are excited about improved gaming support because it brings gaming
to a platform that they already want to use *for other reasons*. Linux is not
Windows, and offers an inferior gaming experience to Windows, but it *does*
offer a superior experience in many other regards! If you are trying out Linux,
you should approach it with an open mind, prepared to learn about what makes
Linux special and *different* from Windows. You'll learn about new software, new
usability paradigms, and new ways of using your computer. If you just want to do
all of the same things on Linux that you're already doing on Windows, why switch
in the first place? The value of Linux comes from what it can do differently.
Given time, you will find that there are many things that Linux can do that
Windows cannot. Leave your preconceptions at the door and seek to learn what
makes Linux special.

I think that so-called "power users" are especially vulnerable to this trap, and
I've seen it happen many times. A power user is someone who deeply understands
the system that they're using, knows about every little feature, knows all of
the keyboard shortcuts, and integrates all of these details into their daily
workflow. Naturally, it will take you some time to get used to a new system. You
can be a power user on Linux &mdash; I am one such user myself &mdash; but
you're essentially starting from zero, and you will learn about different
features, different nuances, and different shortcuts, all of which ultimately
sums to an entirely *different* power user.

The latest LTT video in the Linux series shows the team going through a set of
common computer tasks on Linux. However, these tasks do little to nothing to
show off what makes Linux special. Watching a 4K video is nice, sure, and you
can do it on Linux, but how does that teach you anything interesting about
Linux?

Let me offer a different list of challenges for a new Linux user to attempt,
hand-picked to show off the things which set Linux *apart* in my opinion.

1. **Learn how to use the shell.** A lot of new Linux users are intimidated by
   the terminal, and a lot of old Linux users are understandably frustrated
   about this. The terminal is one of the *best* things about Linux! We praise
   it for a reason, intimidating as it may be. [Here's a nice tutorial to start
   with][ubuntu shell tutorial].
1. **Find and install packages from the command line.** On Linux, you install
   software by using a "package manager", a repository of software controlled by
   the Linux distribution. Think of it kind of like an app store, but
   non-commercial and without malware, adware, or spyware. If you are
   downloading Linux software from a random website, it's probably the wrong
   thing to do. See if you can figure out the package manager instead!
1. **Try out a tiling window manager,** especially if you consider yourself a
   power user. I would recommend [sway], though I'm biased because I started
   this project. Tiling window managers change the desktop usability paradigm by
   organizing windows *for you* and letting you navigate and manipulate them
   using keyboard shortcuts alone. These are big productivity boosters.
1. **Compile a program from source.** This generally is not how you will usually
   find and use software, but it is an interesting experience that you cannot do
   on Windows or Mac. Pick something out and figure out where the source code is
   and how to compile it yourself. Maybe you can make a little change to it,
   too!
1. **Help someone else out online.** Linux is a community of volunteers
   supporting each other. Take what you've learned to [/r/linuxquestions] or
   your distro's chat rooms, forums, wikis, or mailing lists, and make them a
   better place for everyone else. The real magic of Linux comes from the
   collaborative, grassroots nature of the project, which is something you
   really cannot get from Windows or Mac.

Bonus challenge: complete all of the challenges from the LTT video, but only
using the command line.

All of these tasks might take a lot longer than 15 minutes to do, but remember:
embrace the unfamiliar. You don't learn anything by doing the things you already
know how to do. If you want to know why Linux is special, you'll have to step
outside of your comfort zone. Linux is free, so there's no risk in trying ðŸ™‚
Good luck, and do not be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck!
