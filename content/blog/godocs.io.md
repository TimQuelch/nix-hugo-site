Due to the coming sunsetting of godoc.org in favor of pkg.go.dev, I'm happy to
announce that [godocs.io](https://godocs.io) is now available as a replacement.
We have [forked the codebase](https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/godocs.io) and cleaned
things up quite a bit, removing lots of dead or obsolete features, cleaning out
a bunch of Google-specific code and analytics, reducing the JavaScript
requirements, and rewriting the search index for Postgres. We will commit to its
maintenance going forward for anyone who prefers the original godoc.org
experience over the new website.

Notice: this article was rewritten on 2021-01-19. The original article has a lot
of unnecessary salt. [You can read the original here][original].
