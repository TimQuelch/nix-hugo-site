A mercifully cool September is upon us, and after years of searching, I finally
was able to secure Club Mate in the US. Let's decant a bottle and recant the
story of this month's progress in free software development.

First of all, I've been able to put a pin on operations work on SourceHut for
the time being, and focus again on its software development. The GraphQL APIs
are a major focus area here, and I've made a lot of progress towards OAuth 2.0
support and writable GraphQL APIs. Additionally, I've laid out a number of
prioritized tickets for the beta &mdash; with the "beta" label on todo.sr.ht
&mdash; and have been picking items off of the list one at a time, mainly
focusing on meta.sr.ht improvements at first. I'll go into more detail in the
What's Cooking post for SourceHut later today, stay tuned.

There has been some advancements in the little projects: a second Python
implementation of BARE has appeared, another in Common Lisp, and one in PHP;
bringing the total implementations to nine. We have a pretty decent spread of
support among programming languages!

Not much more news to share today. Been focusing in on SourceHut and a secret
project, so check out the What's Cooking post for more details. Thanks for your
support!
