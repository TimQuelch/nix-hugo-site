Hello again! Following a spooky month, we find ourselves again considering the progress of our eternal march towards FOSS world domination.

I’ll first address SourceHut briefly: today is the third anniversary of the opening of the public alpha! I have written a longer post for sourcehut.org which I encourage you to read for all of the details.

In other news, we have decided to delay the release of our new programming language, perhaps by as much as a year. We were aiming for February ‘22, but slow progress on some key areas such as cryptography and the self-hosting compiler, plus the looming necessity of the full-scale acceptance testing of the whole language and standard library, compound to make us unsure about meeting the original release plans. However, progress is slow but moving. We have incorporated the first parts of AES support in our cryptography library, and ported the language to FreeBSD. A good start on date/time support has been under development and I’m pretty optimistic about the API design we’ve come up with. Things are looking good, but it will take longer than expected.

visurf has enjoyed quite a bit of progress this month, thanks in large part to the help of a few new contributors. Nice work, everyone! We could still use more help, so please swing by the #netsurf channel on Libera Chat if you’re interested in participating. Improvements which landed this month include configuration options, url filtering via awk scripts, searching through pages, and copying links on the page with the link following tool.

Projects which received minor updates this month include scdoc, gmni, kineto, and godocs.io. That’s it for today! My focus for the next month will be much the same as this month: SourceHut GraphQL work and programming language work. See you in another month!
