title: Building interactive SSH applications
tags: [ssh, informational, sourcehut]
---

After the announcement of [shell access for builds.sr.ht jobs][builds
announcement], a few people sent me some questions, wondering how this sort of
thing is done. Writing interactive SSH applications is actually pretty easy, but
it does require some knowledge of the pieces involved and a little bit of
general Unix literacy.

On the server, there are three steps which you can meddle with using OpenSSH:
authentication, the shell session, and the command. The shell is pretty easily
manipulated. For example, if you set the user's login shell to
`/usr/bin/nethack`, then [nethack][nethack] will run when they log in. Editing
this is pretty straightforward, just pop open `/etc/passwd` as root and set
their shell to your desired binary. If the user SSHes into your server with a
TTY allocated (which is done by default), then you'll be able to run a curses
application or something interactive.

However, a downside to this is that, if you choose a "shell" which does not
behave like a shell, it will break when the user passes additional command line
arguments, such as `ssh user@host ls -a`. To address this, instead of overriding
the shell, we can override the *command* which is run. The best place to do this
is in the user's `authorized_keys` file. Before each line, you can add options
which apply to users who log in with that key. One of these options is the
"command" option. If you add this to `/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys` instead:

```
command="/usr/bin/nethack" ssh-rsa ... user
```

Then it'll use the user's shell (which should probably be `/bin/sh`) to run
`nethack`, which will work regardless of the command supplied by the user (which
is stored into `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND` in the environment, should you need it).
There are probably some other options you want to set here, as well, for
security reasons:

```
restrict,pty,command="..." ssh-rsa ... user
```

The full list of options you can set here is available in the `sshd(8)` man
page. `restrict` just turns off most stuff by default, and `pty` explicitly
re-enables TTY allocation, so that we can do things like curses. This will work
if you want to explicitly authorize specific people, one at a time, in your
`authorized_keys` file, to use your SSH-driven application.  However, there's
one more place where we can meddle: the `AuthorizedKeysCommand` in
`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Instead of having OpenSSH read from the
`authorized_keys` file in the user's home directory, it can execute an arbitrary
program and read the `authorized_keys` file from its stdout. For example, on
Sourcehut we use something like this:

```
AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/bin/gitsrht-dispatch "%u" "%h" "%t" "%k"
AuthorizedKeysUser root
```

Respectively, these format strings will supply the command with the username
attempting login, the user's home directory, the type of key in use (e.g.
`ssh-rsa`), and the base64-encoded key itself. More options are available - see
`TOKENS`, in the `sshd_config(8)` man page. The key supplied here can be used to
identify the user - on Sourcehut we look up their SSH key in the database. Then
you can choose whether or not to admit the user based on any logic of your
choosing, and print an appropriate `authorized_keys` to stdout. You can also
take this opportunity to forward this information along to the command that gets
executed, by appending them to the command option or by using the environment
options.

## How this works on builds.sr.ht

We use a somewhat complex system for incoming SSH connections, which I won't go
into here - it's only necessary to support multiple SSH applications on the same
server, like git.sr.ht and builds.sr.ht. For builds.sr.ht, we accept all
connections and authenticate later on. This means our AuthorizedKeysCommand is
quite simple:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# We just let everyone in at this stage, authentication is done later on.
import sys
key_type = sys.argv[3]
b64key = sys.argv[4]

keys = (f"command=\"buildsrht-shell '{b64key}'\",restrict,pty " +
    f"{key_type} {b64key} somebody\n")
print(keys)
sys.exit(0)
```

The command, `buildsrht-shell`, does some more interesting stuff. First, the
user is told to connect with a command like `ssh builds@buildhost connect <job
ID>`, so we use the `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND` variable to grab the command line
they included:

```python
cmd = os.environ.get("SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND") or ""
cmd = shlex.split(cmd)
if len(cmd) != 2:
    fail("Usage: ssh ... connect <job ID>")
op = cmd[0]
if op not in ["connect", "tail"]:
    fail("Usage: ssh ... connect <job ID>")
job_id = int(cmd[1])
```

Then we do some authentication, fetching the job info from the local job runner
and checking their key against meta.sr.ht (the authentication service).

```python
b64key = sys.argv[1]

def get_info(job_id):
    r = requests.get(f"http://localhost:8080/job/{job_id}/info")
    if r.status_code != 200:
        return None
    return r.json()

info = get_info(job_id)
if not info:
    fail("No such job found.")

meta_origin = get_origin("meta.sr.ht")
r = requests.get(f"{meta_origin}/api/ssh-key/{b64key}")
if r.status_code == 200:
    username = r.json()["owner"]["name"]
elif r.status_code == 404:
    fail("We don't recognize your SSH key. Make sure you've added it to " +
        f"your account.\n{get_origin('meta.sr.ht', external=True)}/keys")
else:
    fail("Temporary authentication failure. Try again later.")

if username != info["username"]:
    fail("You are not permitted to connect to this job.")
```

There are two modes from here on out: connecting and tailing. The former logs
into the local build VM, and the latter prints the logs to the terminal.
Connecting looks like this:

```python
def connect(job_id, info):
    """Opens a shell on the build VM"""
    limit = naturaltime(datetime.utcnow() - deadline)
    print(f"Your VM will be terminated {limit}, or when you log out.")
    print()
    requests.post(f"http://localhost:8080/job/{job_id}/claim")
    sys.stdout.flush()
    sys.stderr.flush()
    tty = os.open("/dev/tty", os.O_RDWR)
    os.dup2(0, tty)
    subprocess.call([
        "ssh", "-qt",
        "-p", str(info["port"]),
        "-o", "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null",
        "-o", "StrictHostKeyChecking=no",
        "-o", "LogLevel=quiet",
        "build@localhost", "bash"
    ])
    requests.post(f"http://localhost:8080/job/{job_id}/terminate")
```

This is pretty self explanatory, except perhaps for the dup2 - we just open
`/dev/tty` and make `stdin` a copy of it. Some interactive applications
misbehave if stdin is not a tty, and this mimics the normal behavior of SSH.
Then we log into the build VM over SSH, which with stdin/stdout/stderr rigged up
like so will allow the user to interact with the build VM. After that completes,
we terminate the VM.

This is mostly plumbing work that just serves to get the user from point A to
point B. The tail functionality is more application-like:

```python
def tail(job_id, info):
    """Tails the build logs to stdout"""
    logs = os.path.join(cfg("builds.sr.ht::worker", "buildlogs"), str(job_id))
    p = subprocess.Popen(["tail", "-f", os.path.join(logs, "log")])
    tasks = set()
    procs = [p]
    # holy bejeezus this is hacky
    while True:
        for task in manifest.tasks:
            if task.name in tasks:
                continue
            path = os.path.join(logs, task.name, "log")
            if os.path.exists(path):
                procs.append(subprocess.Popen(
                    f"tail -f {shlex.quote(path)} | " +
                    "awk '{ print \"[" + shlex.quote(task.name) + "] \" $0 }'",
                    shell=True))
                tasks.update({ task.name })
        info = get_info(job_id)
        if not info:
            break
        if info["task"] == info["tasks"]:
            for p in procs:
                p.kill()
            break
        time.sleep(3)

if op == "connect":
    if info["task"] != info["tasks"] and info["status"] == "running":
        tail(job_id, info)
    connect(job_id, info)
elif op == "tail":
    tail(job_id, info)
```

This... I... let's just pretend you never saw this. And that's how SSH access to
builds.sr.ht works!
