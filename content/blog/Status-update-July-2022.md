Hello there! It's been a hot July week in Amsterdam, and I expect hotter days
are still to come. I wish air conditioning was more popular in Europe, but alas.
This month of FOSS development enjoyed a lot of small improvements in a lot of
different projects.

For Hare, I have introduced a number of improvements. I wrote a new standard
library module for string templates, [strings::template], and a new third-party
library for working with pixel buffers, [pixbuf]. The templating is pretty
simple &mdash; as is typical for the standard library &mdash; but allows a
fairly wide range of formatting options. We'll be extending this a little bit
more in the future, but it will not be a complete solution like you see in
things like Jinja2. Nevertheless, it makes some use-cases, like code generation,
a lot cleaner, without introducing a weighty or complex dependency.

[pixbuf]: https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/pixbuf

pixbuf is pretty neat, and is the first in a line of work I have planned for
graphics on Hare. It's similar to pixman, but with a much smaller scope &mdash;
it only deals with pixel buffers, handling pixel format conversions and doing
small operations like fill and copy. In the future I will add simple buffer
compositing as well, and extending modules like [hare-png] to support loading
data into these buffers. Later, I plan on writing a simple vector graphics
library, capable at least of rendering [TinyVG] images and perhaps later TinySVG
as well. I'm also working on [hare-wayland] again, to provide a place to display
these buffers.

I also introduced [format::tar], which will serve as the basis of
initramfs-alike functionality for Helios. On the subject of Helios, much work
has been completed. I have implemented a PCI driver and a small proof-of-concept
AHCI driver (for reading from SATA disks). Alexey Yerin has also been hard at
work on the RISC-V port, and has successfully implemented an e1000 ethernet
driver which can send and receive ICMP (ping) packets. I also completed IRQ
control for userspace, so that userspace device drivers can process interrupts,
and used it to write a keyboard driver for a functional [DOOM port]. The full
DOOM port required a fair bit of work &mdash; check out that blog post for the
complete details. The idle thread was also added, so that all processes can be
blocked waiting on interrupts, signals, endpoints, etc. Non-blocking send,
receive, and wait syscalls were also added this month.

I'm working on splitting memory capabilities into separate device- and
general-purpose capabilities, then adding support for destroying capabilities
when they're no longer required. I also implemented pre-emptive multi-tasking
early this month, and the vulcan test suite now has several multi-threaded tests
to verify IPC functionality. However, a couple of pieces are missing &mdash; the
ability to create and work with new cspaces and vspaces &mdash; in order to
spawn new processes. I'll be focusing on these tasks in the coming weeks. With
these pieces in place, we can start working on Mercury and Vulcan: the driver
system.

I'll save the SourceHut news for the "what's cooking" post later today, so
that's all for now. Until next time!
