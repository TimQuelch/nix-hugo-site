title: Reforming the free software message
date: 2023-06-19

Several weeks ago, I wrote [The Free Software Foundation is dying][0], wherein I
enumerated a number of problems with the Free Software Foundation. Some of my
criticisms focused on the message: fsf.org and gnu.org together suffer from no
small degree of incomprehensibility and inaccessibility which makes it difficult
for new participants to learn about the movement and apply it in practice to
their own projects.

This is something which is relatively easily fixed! I have a background in
writing documentation and a thorough understanding of free software philosophy
and practice. Enter [writefreesoftware.org]: a comprehensive introduction to
free software philosophy and implementation.

[writefreesoftware.org]: https://writefreesoftware.org

The goals of this resource are:

- Provide an accessible introduction to the most important principles of free
  software
- Offer practical advice on choosing free software licenses from a free software
  perspective (compare to the OSS perspective at [choosealicense.com]).
- Publish articles covering various aspects of free software in practice, such
  as how it can be applied to [video games][1]

There are also some non-goals, such as:

- Association with any particular free software project or organization
- Non-cooperation with the open source movement

Compare [writefreesoftware.org] with the similar resources provided by GNU
([1][gnu-1], [2][gnu-2]) and you should get the general idea.

The website is itself free software, CC-BY-SA 4.0. You can check out the [source
code here](https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/writefreesoftware.org/) and suggest any
improvements or articles for the mailing list. Get involved! This resource is
not going to solve all of the FSF's problems, but it is an easy way to start
putting the effort in to move the free software movement forward. I hope you
like it!
