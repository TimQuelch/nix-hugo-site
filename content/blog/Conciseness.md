Conciseness is often considered a virtue among hackers and software engineers.
FOSS maintainers in particular generally prefer to keep bug reports, questions
on mailing lists, discussions in IRC channels, and so on, close to the point and
with minimal faff. It's not considered impolite to skip the formalities &mdash;
quite the opposite. So: keep your faffery to a minimum. A quick "thanks!" at the
end of a discussion will generally suffice. And, when someone is being direct
with you, don't interpret it as a slight: simply indulge in the blissful freedom
of a discussion free from faffery.
