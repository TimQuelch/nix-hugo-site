title: Can I be on your podcast?

I am working on rousing the [Hare](https://harelang.org) community to get the
word out about our work. I have drafted the [Hare evangelism][0] guidelines to
this effect, which summarizes how we want to see our community bringing Hare to
more people.

[0]: https://harelang.org/evangelism/

We'd like to spread the word in a way which is respectful of the attention of
others -- we're explicitly eschewing unsolicited prompts for projects to
consider writing/rewriting in Hare, as well as any paid sponsorships or
advertising. Blog posts about Hare, videos, participating in (organic) online
discussions -- much better! And one idea we have is to talk about Hare on
podcasts which might be interested in the project.

If that describes your podcast, here's my bold request: can I make an
appearance?

Here are some mini "press kits" to give you a hook and some information that
might be useful for preparing an interview.

## The Hare programming language

> Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and
> robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a
> minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools,
> compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks. 

Hare has been in development since late 2019 and today has about 100
contributors.

## The Ares operating system

Ares is an operating system written in Hare which is under development. It
features a micro-kernel oriented design and runs on x86_64 and aarch64. Its
design is inspired by the seL4 micro-kernel and Plan 9.

## Himitsu: a secret storage system

> an arbitrary key/value store (where values may be secret) and a query language
> for manipulating the key store. 

Himitsu is written in Hare.
