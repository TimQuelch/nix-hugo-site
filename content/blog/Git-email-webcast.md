title: 'Webcast: Reviewing git & mercurial patches with email'
tags: ["video", "git"]
---

With the availability of new resources like
[git-send-email.io](https://git-send-email.io), I've been working on making the
email-based workflow more understandable and accessible to the world. One thing
that's notably missing from this tutorial, however, is the maintainer side of
the work. I intend to do a full write-up in the future, but for now I thought
it'd be helpful to clarify my workflow a bit with a short webcast. In this
video, I narrate my workflow as I review a few
[sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org) patches and participate in some dicsussions.

Also check out [aerc](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/aerc2), a replacement for mutt
that I've been working on over the past year or two. I will be writing more
about that project soon.
