title: Status update, October 2020

I'm writing this month's status update from a brand-new desktop workstation
(well, I re-used the GPU), my first new workstation in about 10 years. I hope
this new one lasts for another decade! I aimed for something smaller and
lightweight this time &mdash; it's a Mini-ITX build. I've only been running this
for a few days, so let me tell you about the last few accomplishments which are
accountable to my venerable workstation's final days of life.

First, there's been a ton of important work completed for SourceHut's API 2.0
plans. All of the main blockers for the first version of meta.sr.ht's writable
GraphQL API are resolved, and after implementing a few more resolvers it should
be in a shippable state. This included riggings for database transactions,
simplification of the mini-"ORM" I built, and support for asyncronous work like
delivering webhooks. The latter called for a new library, [dowork][dowork],
which you're free to reuse to bring asyncronous work processing to your Go
programs.

I also built a new general-purpose daemon for SourceHut called
[chartsrv][chartsrv], which can be used to generate graphs from
[Prometheus][prometheus] data. The following is a real-time graph of the load
average on the builds.sr.ht workers:

[chartsrv]: https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/chartsrv/
[prometheus]: https://prometheus.io/

![A chart which hopefully shows a reasonable load average across all workers](https://metrics.sr.ht/chart.svg?title=Build%20worker%20load%20average&query=avg_over_time%28node_load15%7Binstance%3D~%22cirno%5B0-9%5D%2B.sr.ht%3A80%22%7D%5B1h%5D%29&max=64&since=336h&stacked&step=10000&height=3&width=10)

I've been getting more into [Gemini][gemini] this month, and have completed
three (or four?) whole projects for it:

[gemini]: https://gemini.circumlunar.space/

- [gmni][gmni] and gmnlm: a client implementation and line-mode browser
- [gmnisrv][gmnisrv]: a server implementation
- [kineto][kineto]: an HTTP->Gemini portal

[gmni]: https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/gmni/
[gmnisrv]: https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/gmnisrv/
[kineto]: https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/kineto/

The (arguably) fourth project is the completion of a Gemini version of this
blog, which is available at `gemini://drewdevault.com`, or via the kineto portal
at [portal.drewdevault.com](https://portal.drewdevault.com). I'll be posting
some content exclusively on Gemini (and I already have!), so get yourself a
client if you want to tune in.

I have also invested some effort into [himitsu][himitsu], a project I shelved
for so long that you probably don't remember it. Worry not, I have rewritten the
README.md to give you a better introduction to it. Here's a screenshot for your
viewing pleasure:

Bonus update: two new [BARE](https://baremessages.org) implementations have
appeared: OCaml and Java.

That's all for now! I'll see you for the next update soon. Thanks for your
support!
