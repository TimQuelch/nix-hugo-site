title: What is Gemini?
---

The [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) protocol is an alternative to
HTTP, and Gemtext is an alternative document format to HTML. This blog is
available over both Gemini and HTTP, and some content is exclusive to each.
To connect with Gemini, you will need a Gemini client. I wrote one called
[gmnlm][gmni], and there are more [listed here][others].

[gmni]: https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/gmni
[others]: https://gemini.circumlunar.space/clients.html

Once you have your client working, direct it to `gemini://drewdevault.com` and
you'll be your way.
